This portfolio is an everchanging record of data analytics projects I have worked on. Currently it contains two recent projects.  
- [Amsterdam Gemente Data API Analysis](https://github.com/Eoghan-O-Neill/Project-Portfolio/blob/main/Amsterdam%20Refuse%20Analysis.ipynb) Accesses data from the public Amsterdam Gemente data API. It then uses Python Pandas and Matplotlib to clean, analyse and visualise the data to gain insights into refuse collection in the Amsterdam area. 
- [Hotel Review Analysis](https://github.com/Eoghan-O-Neill/Project-Portfolio/blob/main/Hotel%20Review%20Analysis.ipynb) Uses Python libraries Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyse Tripadviser hotel reviews.
